                    <p>"<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>" is a dystopian novel published in 1985 by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood. It takes place in a horrible future. The book focuses on the life of Offred, a servant girl deprived of her reproductive rights and personal identity. The novel is told in the first person (Offred's point of view). After the Republic of Gilead comes to power, Offred, her husband and daughter attempt to flee the country but they get arrested and Offred is separated from her husband and daughter. She was sent to the red center, where she will be trained to become a Handmaid. Offred is assigned to a Commander's house where she is forced to follow a routine life of visiting the doctor, having sex and shopping. The reader sees the evolution of Offred's life from an intellectual, loving and independent woman to a handmaid. Most of Offred's memories revolve around her husband, Luke, and daughter. </p>
